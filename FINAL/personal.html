				<h3>Personal Information</h3>
				<p>
					Hi, I'm Bryant. I am nineteen years old and currently live in the city of East Lansing, Michigan, as I attend Michigan State University. Up until attending school here, I had spent my entire life living in and around Grand Rapids, Michigan. Some of the many interests I have are music, movies, audio production, video games, and camping; but music is definitely the one that I enjoy the most. My earliest memories I have of my entire life are of my dad and his bands practicing in our basement, and I do not recall I time in my life where I did not consider myself a drummer, as my dad started teaching me how to drum when I was very young. At ten I started taking guitar lessons and from then on that has always been my main focus. Furthermore, I collects CD's and vinyl LP's. I currently own hundreds upon hundreds of them, and some of the LP's I own are quite rare. I used to play video games quite frequently when I was younger, but have drifted away from that in recent years.
