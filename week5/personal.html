					<p>The general plan for my personal website is pretty simple, I'm going to have a headder along the top with categories such as: About, Music, Hobbies, Resume, and Contact Info. Each of those links will remain in the menu bar no matter which one you click on. Aslo, each one will contain various information in regards to the categry they are under. For example, the Music tab will have lists such as Favorite Bands, Favorite Albums, etc., and the Hobbies tab might contian information about my guitar playing, my drumming, my music collection, and my videogames.</p>
